Kento and I worked together on this project.  At first Kento and I worked separately and shared screens on Discord. 
We practiced merging in github. But mostly we talked through changes. 

Suzette worked on line 43 down. 
Kento worked on the main body up to 43.  
We ran our project multiple times to ensure it was working and we added in nets for errors.
